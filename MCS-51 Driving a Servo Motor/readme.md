# Microcontroller 8051 
AT89C51 Based Projects Using 8051 Assembly 

## 1- MCS-51 Driving a Servo Motor
### Objectives
  - Connecting a microcontroller from the MCS-51 family such as "AT89C51" with Servo-motor through one line of its port.
  - Editing and loading a program code into the microcontroller to control the motor step-angle (from 0o to 180o) by pressing the control switches.
