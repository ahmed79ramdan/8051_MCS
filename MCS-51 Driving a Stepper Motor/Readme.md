# Microcontroller 8051 
AT89C51 Based Projects Using 8051 Assembly 

## 1- MCS-51 Driving Parallel Input-Output Data
###Objectives
 - Connecting a microcontroller from the MCS-51 family such as "AT89C52" with a unipolar Servo-motor through a driver "ULN2003A" via half port lines.
 - Editing and loading a program code into the microcontroller to control the direction of rotation (clockwise and anticlockwise).
