## Objecyives: 

- Connecting a microcontroller from the MCS-51 family such as "AT89C51" with two seven-segment displays (with internal BCD to 7-segment decoder) through one of their ports.
- Editing and loading a program code into the microcontroller to display counting-up decimal values from "00" to "99" with approximate rates 1count/sec.
